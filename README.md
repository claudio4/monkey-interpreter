# Monkey Interpreter

This repository contains my implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter, developed while following the book _Writing An Interpreter In Go_ by Thorsten Ball.

## Overview

Monkey is a simple yet powerful interpreted programming language. This interpreter includes support for:

- Primitive data types: integers, booleans, strings
- Arithmetic and boolean expressions
- Variable bindings and environments
- First-class functions with closures
- Built-in functions (e.g., `len`, `first`, `last`)
- Conditionals and loops
- Metaprogramming and macros.
- A basic REPL for interactive use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the interpreter, you need:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.18 or later recommended)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monkey-interpreter.git
cd monkey-interpreter
```

Build the interpreter:

```sh
go build -o monkey
```

Run the REPL:

```sh
./monkey
```

## Usage

In the REPL, you can enter Monkey code interactively:

```monkey
>> let add = fn(a, b) { a + b; };
>> add(2, 3);
5
```

You can also run Monkey scripts from a file:

```sh
./monkey script.monkey
```
